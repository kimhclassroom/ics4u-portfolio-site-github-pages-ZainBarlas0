# Space Crusader 🚀
Space Crusader is fast paced 2D game made from the ground up using Java Swing framework. You pilot a space ship that gets pulled into an asteroid belt and now you must dodge in coming asteroids and collect coins to increase your score.

## 📖 Project Overview
This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of Java GUI development, multi-threading, and persistent data management. It features a fully functional user authentication system and a synchronized game loop designed for smooth performance.

## 🎯 Project Goals & Purpose
The primary goal of this project was to master the fundamentals of game development within the Java ecosystem, specifically focusing on:
1. **Multi-threading:** Implementing a stable game loop using `Runnable` and managing thread safety with `CopyOnWriteArrayList`.
2. **File I/O:** Managing local databases using `Scanner` and `PrintWriter` for user data and scores.
3. **UI/UX Design:** Creating an interactive interface using Swing components and custom graphics rendering.
4. **Login/Signup:** creating a functioning account creation system
